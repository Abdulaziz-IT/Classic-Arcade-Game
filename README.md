## How to play?

This game is pretty **easy to play**, all you have to do is to reach the water without colliding with the bugs!
- The player can move left, right, up and down
- The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
- Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
- Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won

Keep it mind that if the time is up and you didn't find all cards, you will _lose_ :disappointed:

If you feel like giving up, you can always click on the restart button which will reset the game for you, and shuffle the cards again!

## Can I play now?!
